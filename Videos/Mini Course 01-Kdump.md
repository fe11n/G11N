# Mini Course 01-Kdump

openEuler G11N SIG and Kernel SIG have jointly produced a series of mini courses, presenting Kernel-related technical knowledge in plain language. We hope this will help developers around the world have better understanding about openEuler OS, and look forward to communicating and exploring more with you.
The first course is about Kdump. Through this 10-minute video, you will know what is Kdump, its working principles, and some basic operations. Now, let's get started.
