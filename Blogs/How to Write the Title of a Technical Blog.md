# How to Write the Title of a Technical Blog



A title either works or it doesn't. Unfortunately, there's no general standard to find the best title, only a few tips:

- Have it include a keyword or topic phrase that describes what the article is about.

- Keep it under 10 words.

- Remove functional words (a, of, the, and) where you can.

- Include a number in your title if possible.

  Titles that include numbers are great for readers and search engines alike. They trigger something in the human brain that makes us want to find out more, while working well with Google's search algorithm.

  The best numbers to use in titles are 3, 5, 7, 10, and any multiple of 5 thereafter. There are lots of theories about this. For example, a blog titles "5 Hacks to Help You Succeed as a Developer" will tend to get way more engagement.

- Include "You"/"Your" in your title if possible.

  Including "You"/"Your" in your title will also get more viewer recognition. When you address your reader, it feels more personal and as if you are actually talking to them.

- Start your title with "How to" if needed.

  Starting your title with "How to" is also a great way to appear well in Google's search. A lot of people tend to type "How" into Google when looking for an explanation, so including this is another useful tip.
