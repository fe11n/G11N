## Will You Still Hire Me When I’m 50?

## 当我50岁时，你还会雇佣我吗？

Many programmers wonder whether they will still be hired as they enter their golden years.

很多程序员想知道当自己进入中年之时是否会被录用。

 

If you are a programmer and have been working for more than a few years, I won’t be surprised if thoughts have gone through your head about whether you will still be hireable as you approach your forties and fifties.

如果你是一个程序员并且工作了数年，而你的脑海里经常闪现当自己年近四五十岁时还能否被雇佣的想法时，我并不感到意外。

 

Don’t worry, you are not alone. Traditionally, programming has been looked upon as an industry for young graduates (the average age of a programmer is 32 years old), and the vision of a 55+ year old programmer is something that most of us rarely, if ever, see in technology companies.

不用担心，你并不孤独。传统意义上，主要是年轻人在从事编程工作（程序员的平均年龄为32岁），能继续在科技公司从业的55岁以上的程序员在大多数人来看是凤毛麟角。

 

*Some 43% of Indeed survey respondents said they worried about losing their job because of their age. And 18% said they worry about that possibility “all the time.”* ***[¹](https://www.businessinsider.com/indeed-survey-highlights-ageism-in-the-tech-industry-2017-10)\***

*招聘网站**Indeed**的调查显示，**43%**的受访者表示他们很担心因为年龄而失去工作。**18%**的受访者表示他们一直都处于这种顾虑中。*

 

 

 

As I am about to enter my fifties, I wanted to share my thoughts on what you can do to make sure that you will be even more hireable when you hit fifty than you are now, and take a glimpse into what I try to do to make sure that I am a good pick.

当我即将步入50岁之际，我想分享给你如何在50岁时变得比现在更有竞争力。为了实现这个目标，来看看我是怎么做的。

 

### Others Jumped Ship, Should I?

### 其他人都跳槽，我也要吗？

From early on in my career, I saw fellow programmers who started out with me in my company at the same time, progressing with me from the role of junior developer to senior developer positions, and then suddenly within a few years they “progressed” to positions of team leader or product manager. It seems that they too might have had the same concerns I had and took a quick escape ‘while they could’ and went along a career path that does not have the same ageism concerns as programming.

从我早期的职业生涯开始，我见证了那些同期在公司发展的程序员同事们，与我一起从初级开发人员成长成为高级开发人员，接着在几年内突然“晋升”到团队领导或者产品经理的职位。这样看来，他们可能和我有着相同的顾虑，于是“趁机”逃离程序员这条轨道，走上了另一条没有年龄歧视顾虑的职业道路。

 

As years passed and my former colleagues became my managers, and my manager’s manager, this clearly got me thinking — am I really doing the right thing by staying in my role as a programmer where I am slowly becoming the oldie in the team?

随着时间推移，我之前的那些同事们接二连三的变成了我的经理，甚至是我经理的经理，这不禁令我思考——我是否应该继续做一个程序员，然后慢慢成为团队中的老将？这真的是一条正确的道路吗？

 

My Journey as a Middle-aged Programmer

我的中年程序员之旅

As might be obvious from this post, I stayed on as a programmer, and am extremely glad that I did.

显而易见，我选择继续我的研发事业，继续做一名程序员，并且我非常庆幸我选择了坚持。

 

Just to clarify, I didn’t want to be just another programmer in my team. I made sure that I grew in my skills, making myself invaluable to my team.

这里需要澄清一下，我当时留下并不是想继续做一个边缘程序员。既然选择了这条道路，那我要确信随着工作技能的提升，我要成为团队的中坚力量。

 

Here comes a few tips and techniques that I have used to manage my career — I hope that they will help you stay focused as your career progresses as they have helped me.

我想跟大家分享一些我曾用来管理职业规划的贴士或者说是技巧，希望这些贴士可以帮助你们在职业发展中保持专注，就像他们曾帮助过我一样。

 

### Some Tips

### 职场贴士

Learn from other people

向他人学习

There are a lot of smarter people out there in the tech world — learn as much as you can from them — read books, subscribe to blogs, watch online tech conferences, find a favorite channel and stay passionate about technology. Don’t restrict yourself to free content — if you see a book you’d like, buy it—even if you can’t expense it to your employer and if you find some great publications on Medium, pay for a subscription. The return on investment is well worth it.

技术界有很多聪明的人物，尽可能多的向他们学习—无论是读书，订阅博客，在线观看技术峰会。寻找一个自己喜欢的频道并保持对科技的热情。别把自己局限在一些免费内容里，如果看上一本书你很喜欢，即使老板不会报销这本书的费用，也应该买。如果你在Medium看到一些很棒的出版物，那么花钱订阅。要知道知识和科技上的投资回报往往都很高。

 

Apply your broad experience

充分利用工作经验

Use your experience and wisdom from your previous jobs that younger programmers lack: other programming languages, limited resources for executing software, lack of logs, lesson learned spending nights debugging, months of refactoring.

充分利用那些年轻程序员所不曾拥有的工作经验和智慧，例如：其他编程语言、利用有限资源对执行软件项目、日志缺失、整夜调试中得到的经验以及长达数月的重构。

 

Share

与他人分享

Share knowledge and experience — what you know is extremely valuable and by sharing it you will not only become a go-to person in your development group, but you will also improve the skills of your fellow programmers. Sharing knowledge can be done through Code Reviews, presenting in technical meetings at work, participation in Meetups, or writing blogs.

向他人分享你的知识与经验。通过分享你不仅可以提升你在团队中的地位，也能提高了其他程序员的技能。你可以通过评审代码、技术会议发言、参加Meetups或者写博客来分享给他人。

 

*There is an ancient book called Ethics of The Fathers, written by Jewish Sages nearly 2000 years ago that talks about how we change over the years. We can learn a lot from this wisdom — Twenty years is the age to pursue a livelihood, thirty the age for strength, Forty the age for understanding and fifty the age for counsel. [²](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2099/jewish/Chapter-Five.htm#v22)*

*《圣贤箴言》是一本由犹太先贤在近**2000**年前所著的古书。这本书讲述了人类如何在历史沉浮中蜕变并汲取古人的智慧**——**和孔子提出的观点如出一辙**“**二十而冠，三十而立，四十而不惑，五十而知天命。**”*

 

Stay updated

学无止境

The technology stacks and languages that are available to us as programmers are changing and advancing at an enormous speed. Staying in the same technology, using the same design techniques for a long time is comforting but might not be smart. Don’t get locked into a single technological stack for too long. Whether it’s introducing new techniques or technologies in your group, internal mobility, or even moving to a new job, do what you need to stay technically fresh.

作为程序员，我们所使用的技术堆栈和编程语言正在飞速变化与发展。长期停留在滞后的技术中、沿用之前的设计，虽然舒适但不明智。不要把自己禁锢在单一的技术栈中。无论是在你的团队中引入新的技术，还是内部流动，甚至是换到新的工作岗位上，都要在你所在的技术领域保持学习的热情并不断接受新鲜事物。

 

Go out of your comfort zone

逃离舒适圈

Try not to stay in your comfort zone for too long — volunteer to be the one to learn that new library, write a prototype in a new language, or agree to give a lecture to your team on a recent project. By continually stepping out of your comfort zone, you are ensuring that you will always be growing, and thereby increasing your value.

尽量不要在舒适圈待太久。主动去图书馆学习新的事物，用新的语言写一个框架或者给你的团队做一个最近项目的讲座。慢慢走出舒适圈，你会不断进步，从而提升你的价值。

 

### A Note For My Potential Recruiters

### 给公司招聘人员的建议

You, the recruiters, have a new reality — demographics are changing — the average age of developers in the tech industry is increasing[³](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2004/2004.05847.pdf). It’s important to come to terms with this, and realize that having an older developer in your company is not a bad thing — on the contrary, it’s a great asset since you will now have people with an enormous amount of experience that you, as a technical organization, can tap into.

你们作为公司招聘人员需要接受一个现实，人口结构正在发生变化——科技行业研发人员的平均年龄在不断增长。希望大家可以意识到贵公司里有一位年长的研发人员是有百利而无一害的。站在科技公司角度，可以挖掘这些开发经验丰富的老将们，他们将会成为贵公司的宝贵财富。

 

About 6 years ago, I interviewed a 70-year-old programmer for a developer position in one of my previous companies and was shocked that, even though he passed my interview, he was rejected later on by HR. This was extremely upsetting for me — I am not sure whether I was more upset for this 70-year-old person who just wanted to keep on programming or in shock for myself, seeing how age discrimination might affect me in a few years down. Whether this was age discrimination or not we will never be able to prove it, but I do remember that it shocked me to the core.

大概6年前，我曾在之前的一家公司面试过一个70岁的程序员，应聘开发岗位。令我震惊的是明明他通过了我的面试，却被人力资源部门拒绝了。这件事让我非常难过，我也不确定我是为这位只是想继续从事编程工作的70岁老者难过还是替我自己难过，尤其是当我想到几年后我也会有年龄歧视的顾虑。我们无法证明人力资源部的决定是否是因为年龄歧视或是其他，但我永远记得这件事带给我的冲击。

 

I have a request to all tech recruiters — please relate to the age of your potential programmers as you would to a fine bottle of whisky and not as you would relate to a piece of moldy cheese lying in the back of your fridge

我想对所有科技公司的招聘人员提一个小建议，当提及那些有潜力的程序员年龄时，请看待他们如一瓶上等陈酿的威士忌而不是一块在冰箱里放置许久的发霉奶酪般。

 

There have been a large number of Age Discrimination law suites filed against tech companies in recent years, whether it be unfair dismissals for employees nearing retirement[⁴](https://www.theracetothebottom.org/rttb/2021/2/26/age-discrimination-in-the-tech-industry) or targeted advertisement of tech jobs to 25 to 35-year-olds [⁵](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-lawsuit-discrimination-idUSKBN1EF09B) . Through the public awareness of these suites as well as the fact that no matter what happens, the average programmer is getting old, we are slowly causing recruiters to relate to older programmers as a mature whisky.

近年来，大量关于科技公司年龄歧视的诉讼被不断提交，无论是临近退休的员工起诉公司不合理的解雇，还是大众直指科技公司里只限25-35岁的员工的招聘广告。通过这些大大小小的诉讼，公众意识正在崛起，大家会意识到虽然一大批的程序员在逐年衰老，但我们也在慢慢争取让企业招聘者改观固有的年龄歧视。

 

### Stay Positive!

### 保持乐观

Is this enough? Will tech companies still hire you as a 50-year-old over a 30-year-old? A definite yes. Will there be companies that might reject you without looking at your resume once they see your age? Unfortunately, also a definite yes, but don’t let that deter you as your progress.

是这样吗？那些科技公司会雇佣50岁的你而不是30岁的你吗？答案是会的。会不会有公司一看到你的年龄，直接拒绝你甚至都不用看你的简历？不幸的是，同样会的。但是这都不能阻挡你的步伐，对吗？

 

Remember that in the Tech Sector, due to the enormous growth, it is still an employees market, so lucky for us there is a high demand for programmers.

请记住，由于科技行业巨大的增长，当前依旧是从业者的市场。在高门槛的开发类职位前，恰好我们就是那批绰有余裕的人群。
