Actually a technical blog should not be confined to a particular domain. It can be a diversified range of forms. Common technical blogs may be one of the following:

- An introduction to the up-to-date development/feature of a piece of software/hardware

  For example:

  - [Speaking Your Language: The Transformer in Machine Translation](https://blog.huawei.com/2022/02/01/speaking-your-language-transformer-machine-translation/)
  - [MindSpore Graph Learning: Formulas as Code for 3x to 4x Faster Training](https://blog.huawei.com/2022/05/03/mindspore-graph-learning-formulas-code-faster-training/)

  They bring to readers the advancement of your software/hardware, presenting the cutting-edge features. They can be in series to provide the product progress in time.

- An in-depth survey on a particular topic.

  For example:

  - [How MindSpore Overcomes Bottlenecks in Model Training](https://blog.huawei.com/2022/03/29/mindspore-overcomes-bottlenecks-model-training/)

  These are useful if you're targeting a more interested audience that wants to grab a cup of coffee and learn a ton.

  For example:

  - [Simplify Your React Components with Apollo and Recompose](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/frontend/simplify-your-react-components-with-apollo-and-recompose-8b9e302dea51/)

  These are great for readers that are looking to get in, do a thing, and get out fast. 

- A number list of useful facts around a common topic

  For example:
