Defined by the Localisation Industry Standards Association (LISA):

"Globalization addresses the business issues associated with taking a product global. In the globalization of high-tech products this involves integrating localization throughout a company, after proper internationalization and product design, as well as marketing, sales, and support in the world market."

**In the open source world, globalization also covers both internationalization and localization.**

**(1) Internationalization** is the process of generalizing a product so that it can handle multiple languages and cultural conventions without the need for re-design. Internationalization takes place at the level of program design and document development.

Internationalization requires a set of feature support, for example:

- Separation of text from the software source code. Translatable text, i.e. text which is visible to the user, should be moved to separate strings-only resource files.
- Ability to display the character sets and support local standards of a particular language and country.
- Unicode use, which ensures correct processing and display for all of the world's language scripts.

In general, a product is internationalized during the product development cycle, as a precursor to the localization of a product.

**(2) Localization**, on the other hand, is the process of adapting your internationalized software to meet the language, cultural, and other requirements of a specific target market, otherwise known as a locale, by adding resources and translating content. Localization is also called l10n and is typically conducted by translators on the user-facing components of the software or mobile application.

Localization goes beyond translating languages, though. It also refers to localizing time and date differences, currency, accounting standards, culturally appropriate images, symbols, and hand gestures, spelling, and other locale-specific components (including the RTL language example from above).
