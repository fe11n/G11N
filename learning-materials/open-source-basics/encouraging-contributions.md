What motivates open source software contributors? 

The two main factors linked to engaging in open source contribution are:

- Intrinsic motivations, such as personal enjoyment and altruism

- Career development, professional reputation, and networking (rather than monetary gains)


Here are two easy ways to engage with and retain contributors in your SIG:

**1.**     **Maintaining low contribution barriers**

People with social and intrinsic motives are more likely to stay on the team, but are more likely to be discouraged by technical challenges.

For example, newcomers may feel intimidated if the deliverable standard is raised. Any pull request attempt should be welcomed, whether it is a bug fix, a sentence relocation pull request, or a tool usage issue.

**2.**     **Maintaining comprehensive documents**

Documentation is highly valued, but often overlooked. Lacking documentation in open source is a self-perpetuating cycle of preventing contributions, thus inhibiting engagement by new contributors and constraining project growth. By investing in documentation for contributors, they are likely to feel more able to participate and develop the project, and in addition, the project will likely be better known, as interested people can read about it more easily, and thereby may be encouraged to also contribute.

To encourage frequent and regular contributions to your G11N/I18N SIG, you should ensure you have at least the following documents:

- Contribution guides, covering contact information, contributing procedure, tool usage, quality criteria, team coordination policy, codes of conduct, and other useful information.

- Content writing and localization styles for your open source project, including the repo description, release notes, and README as well as product manuals. They need be written consistently across repos, covering a standard content structure, appropriate voice and tone, and correct grammar.

- It's good practice to start writing the README instruction manual first. It welcomes new contributors, explains the project aims, and how to get started. Oftentimes the importance of README is underestimated and updating it is put off.

- A complete set of product technology manuals, such as product overviews, feature descriptions, and glossaries, as these help contributors better understand and localize the project information.
