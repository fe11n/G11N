There are three primary roles in a SIG: committers, maintainers, and contributors.

| Role        | Description                                                  | Privilege                                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Maintainer  | A person who is responsible for the open source project  development and community. They have full write access to the software repo. | Maintainers can read, clone, and push to the default/master  branch of the repo. They can also manage issues, some repo settings, and pull  requests (like doing **/lgtm** on open pull requests). |
| Committer   | Anyone with the ability to access and edit the repo.         | Committers can make changes to repos that will be used for the  project's next official release. |
| Contributor | Everyone who has contributed to the project in some way, e.g.,  by triaging issues, writing code, or organizing events. | Contributors drive the repo's progress.                      |

- Generally, the founders of a SIG are the initial maintainers.

- Amongst the maintainers, there is a SIG leader, who's responsible for the day-to-day running of the SIG. They are the primary point of contact between the community's governance committee and the SIG.

- A common contributor can apply to become a maintainer when they meet certain criteria, for example, when they have been deeply involved in contributing code, pull request reviews, and triage of issues in the project for more than 3 months.
